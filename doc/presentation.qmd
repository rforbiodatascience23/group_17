## Introduction {.smaller}

:::: {columns}

::: {.column width="49%"}
### PAM50 classification
Based on microarray or RNA-seq data, looking at 50 representative genes to classify breast-cancer tissues, classify samples into four categories:

-   HER2-enriched
-   Luminal A
-   Luminal B
-   Basal like

### Our data

iTRAQ-based mass spectrometry proteome profiling data from 77 breast cancer tissues[^1]

Tumor receptor status for:

- Oestrogen (ER)
- Progesterone (PR)
- Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)

- This is nice
- we can also leave out the bullet list

## Conclusion & Discussion

- As expected, no clustering was seen when analysing the full proteomics data set.
- Considering only the differentially expressed genes, we could some-what replicate the PAM50 classification. 
- In addition, we investigated correlations [...]
