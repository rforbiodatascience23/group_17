## Introduction

### PAM50 classification
Based on microarray or RNA-seq data, looking at 50 representative genes to classify breast-cancer patients, classify samples into four categories:

-   HER2-enriched
-   Luminal A
-   Luminal B
-   Basal like


### Our data

## Conclusion & Discussion

- As expected, no clustering was seen when analysing the full proteomics data set.
- Considering only the differentially expressed genes, we could some-what replicate the PAM50 classification. 
- In addition, we investigated correlations [...]
