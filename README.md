# Data retrieval

The data used for this project was downloaded from <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piotrgrabo/breastcancerproteomes/data>.

3 .tsv files should be downloaded.
It requires a kaggle user to retrieve the data.
The data was downloaded and located into a local folder '\_raw' in the repository root which was unlinked from the version control.

Hence, do these steps to retrieve the data:

1.  Clone the repository to your RStudio IDE.

2.  Create a folder in the repository root and call it '\_raw'.

3.  Download the data from the kaggle link above.

4.  Put the 3 .tsv files in the '\_raw' folder.

And then the scripts should all be runnable.
