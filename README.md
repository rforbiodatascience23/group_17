The data used for this project was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piotrgrabo/breastcancerproteomes/data.
3 .tsv files should be downloaded. 
It requires a kaggle user to retrieve the data. 
The data was downloaded and located into a local folder '_raw' in the repository root which was unlinked from the version control. 

Hence, do these steps to retrieve the data:
1. Clone the repository to your RStudio IDE.
2. Create a folder in the repository root and call it '_raw'.
3. Download the data from the kaggle link above. 
4. Put the 3 .tsv files in the '_raw' folder. 

And then the scripts should all be runnable.
